# simple-dash-app

I created this to learn how to create a Dash app which serves as an UI to a ML model. 
Essentially the user will enter prediction inputs in the app where an output will be returned.

## Data Source

A simple predictive model built based on the following data source: 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II

The app will be based on an extremely naive predictive model on rain wear/umbrella orders.

## Dependencies

Anaconda - 2021.05 Version
Dash 1.19.0
